TASK DESCRIPTION 

Task 1:

Taxation is a term for when a taxing authority (usually a government)
imposes a tax. Imagine having multiple web sites in many countries
(let's call these sites traders) out of which each must follow different
local taxation rules and calculations. Site users bets an amount on the
give odd, e.g. 5 EUR * 1.5 = 7.5 EUR. Everything will be done in EUR
currency to keep it simple.

Prepare a REST service with specified input/output:

"incoming": {
"traderId": 1,
"playedAmount": 5,
"odd": 3.2
}

"outgoing" {
"possibleReturnAmount": Q,
"possibleReturnAmountBefTax": W,
"possibleReturnAmountAfterTax": X,
"taxRate": Y,
"taxAmount" Z
}

Your service must support two types of taxation:

1. General
    - taxation is done per rate or per amount:

   rate: 10%
   7.5EUR * 0.1 = 0.75EUR => possible return amount is 7.5EUR -
   0.75EUR = 6.75
   amount: 2EUR
   7.5EUR - 2EUR = 5.5EUR => possible return amount is 5.5EUR

2. Winnings
    - winnings amount: 7.5EUR - 5EUR = 2.5EUR
    - taxation is done per rate or per amount:

   rate: 10%
   2.5EUR * 0.1 = 0.25EUR => possible return amount is 7.5EUR -
   0.25EUR = 7.25EUR
   amount: 1EUR
   2.5EUR - 1EUR = 1.5EUR => possible return amount is 1.5EUR

Since your doing a REST service you don't have to bother with UI. The
correctness of implementation can be shown with unit/integration tests
or Postman (www.getpostman.com) calls. Technologies: JEE, Spring, Spring
Boot, Maven, etc. How data is stored it's up to you :)
